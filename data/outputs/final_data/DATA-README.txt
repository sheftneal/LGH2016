POINTS DATA:

lon - longitude of estimate location

lat - latitude of estimate location

decade - 10 year period that encompasses all births used in the estimation:

1980 indicates births used in estimation occurred between January 1, 1980 and December 31st, 1989.
1990 indicates births used in estimation occurred between January 1, 1990 and December 31st, 1999.
2000 indicates births used in estimation occurred between January 1, 2000 and December 31st, 2009.

est5m0 - Estimate of child mortality (5m0) measured in units of deaths per 1000 child-years.

The ci___ variables characterize the uncertainty associated with the estimates. ciLow, ciMed, and ciHigh represent the lower end (5th percentile), median (50th percentile), and higher end (95th percentile) of 90% confidence intervals for the 5m0 estimates. Confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap sampling (see Burke et al for details on methods).



GRIDDED DATA:

Gridded data with one layer for each decade (1980s, 1990s, 2000s).

Layers represent 5m0 child mortality estimates for that decade. Confidence intervals are not currently included in the gridded data.
